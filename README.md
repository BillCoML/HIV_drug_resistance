This is a project for the Machine Learning course (STAT469) at the University of Victoria (by Dr. Xuekui Zhang)

The purpose of this project is to find out which machine learning model should perform well to determine the chance of DRUG RESISTANCE in HIV treatments.

I assessed 6 models:
1. Logistic Regression (with L1 regularization)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
3. Elastic Net
4. Decision Tree
5. Multi-task Prediction Model (by Dr. Xuekui Zhang at UVic)
6. Random Forest

After some thoughful comparison, I concluded that in 6 models, Elastic Net performs very well.
